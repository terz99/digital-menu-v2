The project "Digital Menu" is an applications for restaurants. The application, as its name, is a digital menu where 
customers can order things from the restaurant's menu (in the restaurant) using their smartphones. There is no need of 
waiter/customer communication and ordering is done electronically directly to the waiter's user interface. When a customer 
orders something, the waiter will get notification on his user interface and deliver the order to the corresponding table. 

This app is only the digital menu interface and NOT the waiter's interface. It is stil developed by me and @Michona 
(github username).
